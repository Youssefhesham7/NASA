        The seventh planet from the Sun, Uranus boasts the third-largest diameter in our solar system. Using a
        telescope, astronomer William Herschel discovered Uranus in 1781. Initially, Herschel mistook it for a comet or
        a star.
        After two years, the object was finally agreed upon as a new planet, thanks to astronomer Johann Elert Bode's
        observations. Herschel's attempt to name it Georgium Sidus after King George III was unsuccessful, and instead,
        the scientific community went with Bode's suggestion to name it Uranus, after the Greek god of the sky.

      <h2>Namesake:</h2>Even though William Herschel wanted to name his discovery after King George III, he was not
      successful. The planet was finally named after Uranus, the Greek god of the sky, which was suggested by Johann
      Bode.

      <h2>Potential for life:</h2>
      <p> The conditions of Uranus are not suitable for supporting life as we understand it. The planet's atmosphere is
        made up of substances that are most likely too unstable and severe for living beings to acclimate to.
      </p>

      <h2>Size and distance:</h2>
      <P> Uranus is much larger than Earth, with a radius of 15,759.2 miles (25,362 kilometers) that is four times wider
        than our planet. To put it in perspective, if Earth were the size of a nickel, Uranus would be the size of a
        softball. It is located 1.8 billion miles (2.9 billion kilometers) away from the Sun, which is 19.8 astronomical
        units. An astronomical unit (AU) is the distance from the Sun to Earth. The journey from the Sun to Uranus takes
        sunlight 2 hours and 40 minutes from this distance.



      <h2>Orbit and its rotation:</h2> It takes Uranus about 17 hours to complete one rotation, and it takes
      approximately 84 Earth years for Uranus to orbit the Sun. Uranus has a unique tilt of 97.77 degrees, which likely
      occurred due to a collision with an Earth-sized object. This unusual tilt results in the most extreme seasons in
      the solar system, with each pole experiencing direct sunlight for almost a quarter of each Uranian year and a
      21-year-long dark winter for the other half of the planet. Uranus, along with Venus, rotates in the opposite
      direction from most planets, moving from east to west.


      <h2>Moons:</h2>With 27 moons, Uranus has a distinct naming convention for its satellites, unlike other planets
      that name them after Greek or Roman mythology. Instead, Uranus' moons are named after figures from the works of
      Shakespeare and Pope. The inner moons appear to have an equal mix of water ice and rock, while the outer moons are
      thought to be asteroids that were captured by Uranus. However, their composition remains unknown.

      <h2>Rings:</h2> Uranus has two sets of rings, with the inner system consisting of nine narrow, dark grey rings and
      the outer system consisting of a reddish inner ring and a blue outer ring similar to Saturn's E ring. The rings
      are named Zeta, 6, 5, 4, Alpha, Beta, Eta, Gamma, Delta, Lambda, Epsilon, Nu, and Mu in order of distance from the
      planet, and some of the larger rings have belts of fine dust surrounding them.

      <h2>Formation:</h2> About 4.5 billion years ago, Uranus was formed along with the rest of the solar system by the
      attraction of swirling gas and dust by gravity. This ice giant, like Neptune, probably originated closer to the
      Sun before moving to the outer regions of the solar system about 4 billion years ago, where it now resides as the
      seventh planet from the Sun.


      <h2>Structure:</h2>The outer solar system has two ice giants, one of which is Uranus, with Neptune being the
      other. The majority of Uranus's mass is composed of a dense, hot fluid made up of icy materials such as water,
      methane, and ammonia, located above a small rocky core. The temperature near the core can reach up to 9,000
      degrees Fahrenheit (4,982 degrees Celsius). Uranus is slightly larger than Neptune in diameter but smaller in
      mass, making it the second least dense planet; only Saturn is less dense. The blue-green color of Uranus is due to
      the presence of methane gas in its atmosphere, which absorbs the red portion of the light and reflects blue-green
      light back out.
      Surface: Uranus, being an ice giant, lacks a concrete surface. Instead, the planet consists of constantly churning
      fluids. In the event that a spacecraft were to visit Uranus, it would neither be able to land nor survive flying
      through the planet's atmosphere due to the intense temperatures and pressures that would demolish any metal
      spacecraft.

      <h2>Atmosphere:</h2>
      <p> The atmosphere of Uranus is composed mostly of hydrogen and helium, with a small amount of methane and traces
        of water and ammonia. The blue hue of Uranus is due to its methane content. Although Voyager 2 only observed a
        few clouds, a Great Dark Spot, and a small dark spot during its flyby in 1986, recent observations reveal that
        Uranus has dynamic clouds that change rapidly as it approaches equinox. Uranus is even colder than Neptune in
        some places, with a minimum temperature of 49K (-224.2 degrees Celsius) in its planetary atmosphere. Wind speeds
        can reach up to 560 miles per hour (900 kilometers per hour) on Uranus. Wind direction at the equator is
        retrograde, and it blows in the opposite direction of the planet's rotation. However, closer to the poles, winds
        shift to a prograde direction and flow with Uranus' rotation.

      <h2>Magnetosphere:</h2> Uranus boasts a magnetosphere that is peculiarly shaped and irregular. Typically, magnetic
      fields are in parallel alignment with a planet's rotation, but Uranus' magnetic field is askew; it is tipped
      nearly 60 degrees from the planet's axis of rotation and is positioned a third of the planet's radius away from
      its center. Due to the lopsided magnetic field, auroras on Uranus are not in line with the poles like they are on
      Earth, Jupiter, and Saturn. The magnetosphere tail on Uranus, which extends millions of miles into space opposite the Sun, has magnetic field lines that are twisted into a long corkscrew shape by Uranus' sideways rotation.
