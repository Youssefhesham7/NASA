        The third planet from the Sun is our home planet and the only known place where living beings exist. Despite
        being the fifth largest planet in the solar system, Earth is the only world with liquid water on its surface.
        It&apos;s the largest of the four closest planets to the Sun, all of which are composed of rock and metal.
        Unlike other planets whose names are derived from Greek or Roman mythology, Earth&apos;s name comes from Old
        English and Germanic, simply meaning "the ground." Although there are countless names for our planet in the
        languages spoken by its inhabitants, it remains the only one with this particular name.

      <h2>Number of moons:</h2> The Earth&apos;s Moon is situated at an average distance of 238,855 miles (384,400
      kilometers). This indicates that there is enough space between Earth and its Moon to accommodate 30 planets that
      are the size of Earth.

      <h2>Rings:</h2>
      <p> Earth has no rings.</p>

      <h2>Formation:</h2>
      <P> About 4.5 billion years ago, the formation of Earth occurred through the gravitational pull of swirling gas
        and dust. This led to the creation of the third planet from the Sun, which, like other terrestrial planets,
        consists of a solid crust, a rocky mantle, and a central core.</P>

      <h2>Structure:</h2> The Earth is made up of four main layers starting with the solid inner core at the center,
      followed by the outer core, mantle, and crust. The inner core is a sphere made up of iron and nickel metals with a
      radius of approximately 759 miles. The temperature in the inner core can go as high as 9,800 degrees Fahrenheit.
      Surrounding the inner core is the outer core, which is a layer of fluids made up of iron and nickel and is
      approximately 1,400 miles thick. The thickest layer is the mantle, which is a hot, molten mixture of rock with a
      consistency similar to caramel. The mantle is about 1,800 miles thick. Finally, the outermost layer is the crust,
      which is about 19 miles deep on land and thinner at the bottom of the ocean, extending about 3 miles from the
      seafloor to the top of the mantle.

      <h2> Surface:</h2> Similar to Mars and Venus, Earth has its own share of natural features such as mountains,
      valleys, and volcanoes. The lithosphere of Earth, which comprises of the continental and oceanic crusts as well as
      the upper mantle, is divided into huge plates that are constantly in motion. These plates move in different
      directions and at different rates, causing a variety of geological phenomena such as earthquakes, mountain
      formation, and plate separation. The global ocean of Earth, which covers more than two-thirds of the planet&apos;s
      surface area, has an average depth of approximately 4 kilometers and holds 97% of the planet&apos;s water. Most of
      Earth&apos;s volcanoes are located under the oceans, including Hawaii&apos;s Mauna Kea volcano, which is taller
      from base to summit than Mount Everest but mostly submerged. Additionally, the longest mountain range on Earth is
      not found on land, but rather at the bottom of the Arctic and Atlantic oceans. Surprisingly, this underwater
      mountain range is four times longer than the Andes, Rockies, and Himalayas combined.

      <h2>Atmosphere:</h2> Above the Earth&apos;s surface, there exists an atmosphere that is composed of 78% nitrogen,
      21%
      oxygen, and 1% other gases, including argon, carbon dioxide, and neon. This atmosphere plays a significant role in
      both the long-term climate of the Earth and the short-term weather patterns that we experience. In addition, it
      acts as a protective shield against harmful radiation from the Sun and helps to prevent meteoroids from striking
      the Earth&apos;s surface. Many meteoroids burn up in the atmosphere and can be seen as meteors in the night sky.
      Magnetosphere: Due to the quick rotation of our planet and the fact that it has a molten core made of nickel and
      iron, Earth has a magnetic field. This field gets distorted into a teardrop shape in space by the solar wind,
      which is a continuous stream of charged particles emitted by the Sun. When these charged particles get stuck in
      Earth&apos;s magnetic field, they interact with air molecules above the magnetic poles, causing them to light up
      and create aurorae, also known as the northern and southern lights. The magnetic field is also responsible for
      compass needles pointing towards the North Pole, no matter which way you turn. However, the magnetic polarity of
      Earth can change, leading to a reversal of the magnetic field&apos;s direction. Scientists have found that this
      reversal happens roughly every 400,000 years, but the timing is unpredictable. While such a reversal is unlikely
      to occur for at least another thousand years, when it does happen, compass needles will point in various
      directions for a few hundred years while the switch takes place. It&apos;s essential to note that a magnetic
      reversal isn&apos;t harmful to life on Earth.

      Face towards the opposite direction and look south instead of north.
