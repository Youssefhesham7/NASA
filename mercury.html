        Mercury is the smallest planet in our solar system and is located closest to the Sun. It is only slightly larger
        than Earth's Moon. If you were on Mercury's surface, the Sun would appear over three times larger than it does
        on Earth, and the sunlight would be up to seven times brighter. Despite its proximity to the Sun, Mercury is not
        the hottest planet in our solar system. That distinction belongs to Venus, which has a dense atmosphere.
        Mercury's orbit is elliptical and its rotation is slow, causing the Sun to appear to rise briefly, set, and then
        rise again from certain parts of the planet's surface. This same phenomenon occurs in reverse at sunset.


      <h2>Namesake:</h2>
      <p> The ancient Roman god known for his speed has given his name to a planet called Mercury.

      <h2>Potential for life:</h2>
      <P> Life as we know it cannot survive on Mercury due to its harsh environment. The extreme temperatures and solar
        radiation on the planet are unsuitable for organisms to adjust to.



      <h2>Size and distance:</h2>Mercury, with a radius of 1,516 miles (2,440 kilometers), is roughly one-third the size
      of Earth. If Earth were the size of a nickel, Mercury would be the size of a blueberry. The planet is 0.4
      astronomical units away from the Sun, which is the equivalent of 36 million miles (58 million kilometers).
      Sunlight takes about 3.2 minutes to travel from the Sun to Mercury at this distance.



      <h2>Orbit and rotation: </h2> Mercury has a very elliptical orbit that takes it as close as 29 million miles and
      as far as 43 million miles from the Sun. It is the fastest planet in our solar system, traveling at nearly 29
      miles per second. Despite its slow rotational speed, Mercury experiences a peculiar sunrise and sunset phenomenon
      due to its fast movement around the Sun when it is closest to it. A full day on Mercury lasts 176 Earth days, and
      it does not have seasons because its axis of rotation is almost perfectly upright.

      <h2>Moons:</h2>Mercury has no moons.

      <h2>Rings:</h2>Mercury has no rings.

      <h2>Formation:</h2> Around 4.5 billion years ago, Mercury was created as gas and dust swirled together due to
      gravitational force, resulting in the formation of this small planet closest to the Sun. Similar to other rocky
      planets, Mercury comprises of a core at its center, a mantle made of rock, and a solid crust on the surface.

      <h2>Structure:</h2>
      <p> Following Earth, Mercury is the second most dense planet. The planet contains a significant metallic core,
        with a radius of approximately 2,074 kilometers or 1,289 miles, which accounts for about 85% of the planet's
        radius. There is some indication that the core is partially liquid or molten. In contrast to Earth, Mercury's
        outer shell, equivalent to the mantle and crust, is only 250 miles or 400 kilometers thick.

      <h2>Surface:</h2> Mercury's surface is similar to the Moon's, with numerous impact craters caused by meteoroids
      and comets. These craters and features are named after famous deceased artists, musicians, and authors, such as
      Dr. Seuss and Alvin Ailey. The planet also has large impact basins, such as Caloris and Rachmaninoff, created by
      asteroid impacts during the solar system's early history. Mercury's surface also has smooth terrain, but there are
      cliffs, some of which are hundreds of miles long and a mile high, formed as the planet's interior cooled and
      contracted over billions of years. Most of the surface appears greyish-brown, but bright streaks called "crater
      rays" are formed when an asteroid or comet hits the surface, releasing a tremendous amount of energy and crushing
      rock under the point of impact. Some of the crushed material is thrown far from the crater and falls to the
      surface, forming the rays. When rock particles are crushed into smaller pieces, they become more reflective and
      appear brighter. However, the harsh conditions in space, including dust impacts and solar-wind particles, cause
      these rays to darken over time. The surface of Mercury is subjected to extreme temperatures that can reach up to
      800 degrees Fahrenheit during the day, while plummeting to minus 290 degrees Fahrenheit at night. Despite the high
      temperatures on the sunlit regions of the planet, there may be water ice present in deep craters at the north and
      south poles that are in permanent shadows, where the cold temperatures could preserve the ice.
      Mercury doesn't have an atmosphere, but it does have a very sparse exosphere. This exosphere is formed from atoms
      that were ejected from the planet's surface by the solar wind and impacts from meteoroids. The exosphere of
      Mercury is made up of a mixture of oxygen, sodium, hydrogen, helium, and potassium.


      <h2>Magnetosphere:</h2>The positioning of Mercury's magnetic field is not aligned with the equator of the planet. Despite being weaker than Earth's magnetic field, it can combine with the magnetic field of the solar wind to produce powerful magnetic hurricanes that channel the swift and hot solar wind plasma towards the planet's surface. Upon impact, the ions cause neutral atoms to detach and propel them upwards into the atmosphere.
